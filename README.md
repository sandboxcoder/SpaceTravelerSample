# Space Traveler

Sample project that utilizes C++ 20 modules with CMake for Visual Studio.

## Building this Project
In order to build you will need to download CMake (at least 3.29.3) to build the solution.  

Below is the following command I used to generate the Makefiles on Windows (note for Linux/Unix, use "Unix Makefiles"):

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" ..

```
